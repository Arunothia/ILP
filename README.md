The code is written in progol. It has been clearly commented for better understanding! In case, you are not sure about how to read a progol code, do read the progol.ps manual. 

(1) check_mate.pl

Gives rules for check mate configurations in K-R-K End Game Chess.


(2) draw.pl

Gives rules for some special* draw configurations in K-R-K End Game Chess.

Special* because, I have deliberately made sure to include only the draw cases that are produced by Black King killing off the White Rook. 
Cases of draw from repeated loops seem to require different set of attributes (some what even involving previous moves and stuff) which I have not implemented in this code!


After successful installation of progol, run the code by using the command 

progol <file_name>


Thank you!! Cheers :D
